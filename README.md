#Python Code to Combine a Collection of .jpg Files into a Single PDF


I organised the .jpg and .pdf files into separate folders _after_ I ran the .py file. So, I'd suggest, for simplicity's sake, doing the same - run the .py files in the same folders as the .jpg files. Then sort them after. Alternatively, you can just change the path to folder in the .py scripts.
