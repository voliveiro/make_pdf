# Python Code to Combine a Collection of .jpg Files into a Single PDF

For simplicity's sake, I ran the .py file to convert the .jpgs into a PDF in the same folder as the images. But, you may wish to store your images in a different folder, in which case be sure to adjust the path to folder in your code. 

The sample I worked on was the document named Serving_Singapore.pdf
